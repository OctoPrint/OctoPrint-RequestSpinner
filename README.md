# OctoPrint-RequestSpinner

The Request Spinner Plugin puts a little spinner icon in the lower left corner of the OctoPrint web interface whenever
there are active background requests via AJAX in progress. That provides a bit of feedback about how long your actions
take to get processed by your server and gives you some more indication if stuff is actually happening or not.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:
